- [SOLIDITY](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.9/#): Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. It is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). There are many other blockchains (other than Ethereum) that are EVM compatible. If you’re interested to learn more I recommend reading the Introduction to Smart Contracts section in the Solidity docs.
- [REMIX](https://remix.ethereum.org/): IDE Ethereum  
- [TRUFFLE](https://www.trufflesuite.com/): A world class development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for blockchains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
- [HARDHAT](https://hardhat.org/): Development environment that facilitates building on Ethereum
- [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) Foundry is an environment where you can test your contracts with Solidity. If you do not have a strong background in JS, Foundry is the best for you!
